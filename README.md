## About Angular JS

AngularJS is built on the belief that declarative programming should be used to create user interfaces and connect software components, while imperative programming is better suited to defining an application's business logic. The framework adapts and extends traditional HTML to present dynamic content through two-way data-binding that allows for the automatic synchronization of models and views. As a result, AngularJS de-emphasizes explicit DOM manipulation with the goal of improving testability and performance.

AngularJS's design goals include:

- to decouple DOM manipulation from application logic. The difficulty of this is dramatically affected by the way the code is structured.
- to decouple the client side of an application from the server side. This allows development work to progress in parallel, and allows for reuse of both sides.
- to provide structure for the journey of building an application: from designing the UI, through writing the business logic, to testing.

AngularJS implements the MVC pattern to separate presentation, data, and logic components.[6] Using dependency injection, Angular brings traditionally server-side services, such as view-dependent controllers, to client-side web applications. Consequently, much of the burden on the server can be reduced.

## Learning Angular JS

Angular JS has the most extensive and thorough documentation and video tutorial library of any modern web application framework. The [Angular JS documentation](https://docs.angularjs.org) is thorough, complete, and makes it a breeze to get started learning the framework.
